## Features

- **Open-source** - Want to contribute to Ultimatum? Just submit a pull request!
- **Auto-updates** - No need to reset the script to receive updates!
- **Offline support** - Ultimatum automatically caches itself so you can keep using it even when GitHub is down.
- **Highly undetectable** - You won't be getting banned any time soon!
- **High exploit support** - Practically any exploit can run it!

*Keep in mind that the effectiveness of these features is dependent on the quality of your exploit. Exploits like [Script-Ware](https://script-ware.com) ($20) or [Krnl](https://krnl.place) (free) are recommended.*

## Usage

In order for offline support to work, you ***MUST*** use the loader directly.

Copy the [loader](/Loader.lua), paste it in your exploit's script editor, press Execute and enjoy!
